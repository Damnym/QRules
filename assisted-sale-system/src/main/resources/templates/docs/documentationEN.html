						We do have an in house financing plan where you can make a deposit of $500 to lock in your date. We do send you a link to your portal where
						it has the details of the procedure, what is included, and the pricing. After you have made the deposit it will show the payment and the
						balance you owe. Whenever you would like to make a payment towards your procedure you can let us know and we will send you a new link that 
						will take you back into your portal where you can make additional payments. We do not charge interest or fees, or require set payments, the 
						amount and frequency of payments is up to you. You do have up until 2 weeks prior to surgery to use the portal to make payments with your 
						debit/credit card. Any remaining balance can be brought in cash on the day before surgery when you come in for pre op.

						Alpheon is accepted at the regular price of the procedure. You will need to apply for Alphaeon on their website, and they do approve you based on 
						your credit score and history. Once you are approved, you can do the deposit of $550 from the Alpheon account to lock in your procedure and the 
						balance will be taken on the day of pre op. Please note that the account holder does need to be present at pre op to sign and approve the payment, 
						not only the account user.
